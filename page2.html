            <p class="PG1">The learning fundamental highlighted will be looked at in this example; imagine you have a cup, in the cup are tea leaves, then you pour water but can’t drink the tea because of the tea leaves in that cup, what do you do? You get a separate cup and a tea sterner and you get the cup having the tea leaves and you pour it into the separate cup using the tea sterner for the seprate cup to only have tea while the original cup only has the tea leaves left out. This is what flittering is, it’s about getting that information that is useable and more relevant and leaving out information that has no purpose for studying goals. </p>

            <p class="PG2">People, especially younger people mostly follow everything they see or hear, it’s mostly seen through their habit of following social media trends most of the time. This can also apply to learning; we mostly copy and paste or highlight what we see on our textbooks or other pieces of learning material rather than creating it to suit our personal perspective, this can be why learning is hard, knowledge is just transferred from the learning material, lecture and straight to our notebooks and passing our mind and is not really turned into how way we understood the information. To create information that’s more retainable and reusable it may involve improving the way you take notes or the way you organize the information in your mind and print it into your notebook.</p></div>

            <img id="img3" src="intelligence.jpg" height="330"/>
            <p class="PG4">Just as much as making connections with people is important this also relates to the information we are taking in. In relation to learning, connecting is about taking a single piece of information, finding what could possibly relate to it and connecting them together as a way of understanding both concepts without spending so much time on one piece of information. This way of learning improves both memory and understanding because it forces your mind to find an important piece of information and find a relating piece of information and put them together; this is more like a puzzle instead of spending so much time trying to understand a single puzzle piece, find a similar puzzle piece and another and another and put them together to get a big picture. This can also relate to our daily lives; when we have a friend and that friend either has a younger or older sibling we instantly member that sibling they have because the two have a connection and it’s that their brother and sister, sisters or brothers. So by connecting information you’re following the saying “Killing two birds with one stone.” Because you save time, cover large numbers of information and most importantly you’re learning efficiently.</p>

            <img id="img4" src="Bakugou Katsuki and Deku _ My hero academia _.jpg"/>
            <p class="PG5">Comparing, why is it useful? In the modern world we are always comparing things, and when we compare them we see their strengths and weaknesses, what they can do, what they can’t do, what they can do better than the other and what they can’t do better than the other, in doing so we understand the parties put against each other without any failure. By doing this when we are understanding information we understand concepts brought out by two topics or chapters easily just by making them face-off each other. More about this fundamental will be highlighted on the site. </p>

            <img id="img5" src="vector-continuous-line-people-thinking_844724-20969.jpg" height="430"/>
            <p class="PG6">Visualisation is a powerful learning fundamental that should always be included in our learning. When learning it’s best that our mind sees the information through a colourful and memorisable example rather than trying to remember the huge blocks of words you wrote in your notebook that can appear overwhelming to recall or to even review. It can be put like this; if your studying the dentition of a cat and you try to remember what we’re the words on your notebook then prepare to receive alot of hardship because your mind will see most of the information as the same and that can be confusing but if you can picture a cat with its mouth open and all its teeth labelled and accounted for in the mind then you will instantly retrieve that information. Another important thing to know is that by having the information represented as a colourful image (visual aid) you will make information go from short-term memory to long-term memory, to do this simply find the time to draw out your thought process, just make the information the way your mind really views the it or draw funny drawings of figures representing the information in you notes you take. </p>

            <p class="PG7">What really makes learning boring and uninteresting? What really makes learning boring and uninteresting is when you read the learning material, take notes, rest, come back for reveal and repeat. This is a common circle we mostly fall into and is one that makes us believe this is us learning and understanding when really we are making learning a copy and paste and reveal process. To make learning interesting we need to include one procedure into the circle to complete the learning process which is challenging our understanding and we need to look beyond ordinary practice questions and quizzes when really we need to test our level of understanding through techniques like the Feynman technique. This is a technique that tests our understanding of a concept by writing on a separate piece of paper in our own words how we understood the learning material and all this done without looking at the learning material but just from recall, now this doesn’t mean that you’ll always get it correct but it will challenge your understanding and from that trial and error learning will no longer become a boring process but a game until you add the challenge stage. </p>
