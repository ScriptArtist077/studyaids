    <h4>1.Feynmaning</h4>
                         <p>The word ‘ Feynmaning’ comes from the technique known as the Feynman technique, this is a well- known studying technique that is mostly about writing in one’s own words how they understood the concept straight from memory without having to look at the learning material. Why this has helped when taking notes is simple, when you write an explanation of a concept in its simpler version that same explanation can act as a dummies easy to understand reference to create more constructive notes and the process of making this reference forces your brain to make the information as easy to understand that it can even be taught to a child</p>

    <h4>2.Dialoguing</h4>
                         <p>Dialoguing may sound like an odd way of note-taking but it’s based out of what people do every day in their lives knowing and unknowingly. Like mentioned before dialoguing is something people do every day knowingly and unknowingly, when we enter a conversation with someone there can be a lot of questions thrown back and forth, answers to those questions can be given and knowledge is shared as well as the use of many references to explain hard to understand topics, these are some of things that can make a conversation to be engaging and the most important one is the idea of asking questions (?). Now, how will asking questions make studying to be engaging? When questions are asked this forces your mind to retrieve information it has and find means to properly explain it as simple as possible, now you don’t need a person with you to study in order to use dialoguing this can be done simply on your own
       <ol>
           <h4 id="heading4">How To Dialogue when studying</h4>
           </ol>
                         <li id="item"> 1.	Write a point not as point but as a question with a question mark (?)</li>
                         <br>
                          <li id="item">2.	Answer the same question you asked to yourself just below the question</li>
                          <br>
                          <li id="item" >3.From your given answer find a question a person would ask you in a conversation
                          By doing this throughout your studying without looking at the studying material you easily create constructive notes straight from memory and you are testing your understanding, if an answer to question is wrong you can simply check for the right answer and learn from your mistake. So to conclude by doing this you are creating constructive notes and actively recalling from memory.</li>

    <h4>3.Expressing Notes Through Visual Aids</h4>
                         <p>From the learning fundamentals under visualisation you already understand the importance of having information represented as colourful drawings and why we should find time to draw out how thought process of information we take in, now we need to know what it really takes to make these visual aids 
                           <h4 id> << How To Make Visual Aids.. >> </h4>
                           <p>
                                1.	Have a rough work paper to plan out the drawings you’re going to use
                            (This step is optional)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2.	Make the drawings as easy to draw out as possible
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            3.	 The drawings created make them tell a non-verbal story that represents the information being displayed.
