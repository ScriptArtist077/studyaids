                        In this site we’re going to dive into simple tips, tricks, and methods to make studying much more enjoyable, effective and time saving. We as the developers of this site have outlined studying methods that can improve your progress in studying. They don’t involve ChatGTP, Chatsonic, Jasper Chat or any other form of Ai assistance to help you study only the use of a pen and paper. These methods may include the Feynman technique, Pamadaro, Active recall, T-Tree note taking and others, however these techniques are not our creations we only highlighted them and frequently use them and apart from those methods we also highlighted methods of studying that have been forgotten but are the most underrated methods to effective studying

                 <p> We are a group of individuals who enjoy the thrill of learning and who also use Ai to assist us in our studies but we have noticed a dependency of Ai that’s becoming out of hand.</p>

                <h2>What we came for?</h2>
                    <p> Like mentioned the dependency of Ai is becoming out of hand and we came to pull people out of the Ai addiction and bring back the old methods of understanding what one studies, we’re not here to bad mouth Ai assisted studying but to give the old methods a time to be remembered and used in order for people to balance between Ai assisted studying and one’s own thinking capacity to study.</p>
